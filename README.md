super_explained
===============

An IPython notebook explaining how Python's super() works.

To use the notebook, clone the project and `cd` to the directory containing the `.ipynb` file. Then start the IPython (Python 3.x) notebook something like this:

    % ipython3 notebook
    
This will (or at least should) pop up a new browser window for your notebooks, and one of the available notebooks will be named 'super_explained'. Open that up and go to town!
